    title="Our Mission"
    desc="Founded in 2015, Sklonište began as a small group of volunteers feeding stray dogs in an abandoned warehouse. Today, we manage a fully functional facility that houses over 100 animals at any given time. Our mission is simple but challenging: to rescue abandoned, abused, and neglected animals, provide them with medical care and rehabilitation, and find them loving, permanent homes. We advocate for sterilization and responsible pet ownership education."
